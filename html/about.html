              <h2>CLUB HISTORY</h2>
              <p>
                The West Vancouver Cricket Club was formed in 1955 by three
                Kerrisdale players, Tom Guy, Dr George Mott and John Able, who
                felt that there was enough potential in the area to form a club.
                That summer a series of friendly fixtures was played against
                other clubs in the mainland league, using a small nucleus and
                borrowed players. The response was so favourable that in 1956 a
                full 'A' team was entered into the league. In 1957, a team was
                entered in both 'A' and 'B; Divisions and in the early 1960's
                the club fielded three teams for a number of years. However this
                was later cut back to two teams. Any West Vancouver player will
                point out that the lack of championship points up the rather
                holiday air that West Vancouver brings to its cricket!
              </p>

                In it's infancy, the ground itself could be found in Ambleside,
                100 yards from the beach with the scenic North Shore Mountains
                rising almost from the edge of the ground. As far as beauty is
                concerned, few grounds can compare. The new ground now as it
                stands at Hugo Ray Park is a little higher into the mountains
                which has become the permanent home of the West Vancouver
                Cricket Club with full playing, practicing and social
                facilities. There is no truth to the old story that the
                submarine ball was first discovered at West Vancouver's
                Ambleside pitch during high tide.

                West Vancouver boasts one of the largest junior programs in BC
                and every year the number of teams increase. Teams play in a
                Saturday Morning Junior League and there is an active schools
                program in conjunction with schools on the North Shore.
                <br />
                The future looks bright for West Vancouver, as the teams are
                gaining every year in both numbers and strength.

            The West Vancouver Cricket Club has a long and proud history dating
            way back to 1955. Last Saturday, at their clubhouse in West
            Vancouver's Hugo Ray Park, the club honoured its lifetime members
            and alumni in a special ceremony acknowledging their dedication and
            commitment to the sport. Currently, the club is at risk of losing
            their playing fields at Hugo Ray and are fighting to preserve the
            grass fields - fields they say are among the best in North America.
            The club has produced champion league players at both the local and
            national levels.
