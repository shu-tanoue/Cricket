            Kanga or softball cricket is the ideal way to introduce your child
            to the basic skills of cricket. The modified program works on the
            effective method of introducing and practicing a skill then
            following it with a game. This method has proved both a learning and
            enjoyable environment for all our budding young cricketers in both
            our junior program and our summer camps.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program also offers regulation hardball cricket geared towards
            those who possess past experience in the game. The rotational
            program will see participants take part in a number of cricket
            sessions under the guidance of professional coaches and players.
            Training sessions, including batting and bowling provide a great
            opportunity to learn and improve and modified games are regular
            features.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cricket can be played by both boys and girls and we welcome kids of
            all abilities and skills levels.
