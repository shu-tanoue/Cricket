                <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
                <p>We are a lively, friendly group of women who have one shared love - CRICKET!  We have some players with a season's experience who are becoming a dab hand with the bat and ball, but we also welcome complete beginners or anyone who used to play at school or has previous experience and wants to play the best summer sport there is!  If you are a woman or a girl aged 12 and over and would like to play or know any friends who would like to join please contact us and we will be happy to welcome you!</p>
                <h1>WHAT WE DO</h1>
                <p>In 2011, our first season together, our team played 5 games in a league and 1 invitational game against the Wicket Maidens from Victoria.  we are hoping to have regular league matches throughout the coming season as well as some social games with our over 40's team, our junior hardball team and other willing opponents!  We have set new aims and goals and we are hoping that 2016 is going to be a great season.</p>
                <h1>WINTER TRAINING</h1>
                <p>While it's cold and wet outside, we'll be having indoor training sessions in a North Shore school gym.  We still have to confirm the location but training will start in the middle of January 2016 until mid March when we will take a break until our season starts again at the end of April 2016!  In our winter training we will be going over the basics of cricket for any new women who haven't played before, but it is also a great chance for those already playing to get their eye back in after the winter break!</p>
                <h1>SUMMER TRAINING AND MATCHES</h1>
                <p>Starting in May 2016 we will train every Monday evening from 6:30 - 8:00 pm during the summer at West Vancouver Cricket Club, Hugo Ray Park doing both nets and outdoor fielding practice.  From May to August 2016 we will have regular matches on Sundays and some Monday holidays as part of the women's league against teams including the No Ballerz from Chilliwack and hopefully other women's teams from Abbotsford and Surrey.</p>
                <h1>FIXTURES</h1>
                <p>Fixtures will be posted once we have the 2016 Schedule.</p>
